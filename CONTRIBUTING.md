* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/HumanisingAutonomy/versioned_collection/issues/new). Be sure to include as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** that will help us reproduce your issue or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Always include the corresponding issue number.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change by [opening an issue](https://github.com/HumanisingAutonomy/versioned_collection/issues/new) and let's discuss it before putting any time and effort in actually implementing it.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use versioned_collection by creating a new[support request issue](https://github.com/HumanisingAutonomy/versioned_collection/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=support-request.yml).

* If you see that more people struggle with the same thing, because of the lack of examples, or clear documentation, feel free to send a PR that improves the documentation or adds some tutorials or Jupyter Notebooks that do a better job at explaing the problem.
